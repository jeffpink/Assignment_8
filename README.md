##### 1. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.

> Luca showed me the select function! 

##### 2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

##### 3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?

##### 4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
